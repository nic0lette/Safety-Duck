Safety Duck

Safety Duck is a Firefox extension that allows for the tagging of images that may cause various "triggers", and hides them when they are references on a web page.

It actually allows tagging of images with the "personal" reason currently, but no way to untag, or to tag for any other reason.

TODO:
Have the blocking be reversible.
Have the sub-menu checkbox get checked for each reason the image is blocked.
If an image is no longer blocked for any reason, show it again.

After this it gets tricky...
Build a way to have local + remote blacklists.
Build a local whitelist(?) for images blocked remotely that the user wants to see.
